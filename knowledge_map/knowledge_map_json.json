This uses technologies which convert radio frequency (RF) to fiber optical (FO) signals, amplifies those signals and splits them for delivery to multiple end devices. With an active antenna, powered directly via optical fiber, a cost-effective and faulttolerant connection can be established when connected via the structured cabling system.",
